# TODO

- [ ] Bootstrap scripts for **Portable mode** (for demonstration and testing purposes or when the machine is not mine)
  - [ ] This might required a lots of work, maybe move it to another project entirely ?
  - [ ] No machine modifications (or at least keep it as minimum as possible)
  - [ ] Required internet access as few as possible, preferably only at bootstrap time.
  - [ ] All applications should be download to a single directory and symlink their binaries to a single PATH variable environment.
  - [ ] Use cli applications only.
  - [ ] Should be easy to revert and clean up.
  - [ ] Single command, all options should be pass to script as cli argument, after that, don't ask for user's input.
- [ ] Toggle Terminal Background Opacity
- [ ] Quick select terminal background via `fzf`
- [ ] Manage API keys and tokens via `age`
- [ ] Dynamic ssh config profiles (change hostname based on current machine)
- [ ] Add nvim-obsidian plugins
- [x] Maybe add some screenshots to flex my setup ?
- [ ] Quick open DevNote keymap
