# The following GNU Emacs style escape sequences are available when specifying key sequences:
# \C-   control prefix (Ctrl)
# \M-   meta prefix (Alt)
# \e    an escape character
# \\    backslash
# \"    a double quotation mark
# \'    a single quote or apostrophe

# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for
# programs that use the GNU Readline library.  Existing
# programs include FTP, Bash, and GDB.

# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r.
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
